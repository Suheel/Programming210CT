#Week 2
#Question 5
#Write the pseudocode corresponding to functions for addition, subtraction and multiplication 
#of two matrices, and then compute A=B*C â€“2*(B+C), where B and C are two quadratic matrices of order n. 
#What is the run-time? 

def AddMatrices(A,B):
  answer=[]
  # the function above will add the two matrices together
  
  if len(A) == len(B) and len(A=[0]) == len (B=[0]):
  #THIS CODE WILL NOW CHECK IF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE MATRICES MATCH
  
  
  For i in range (A=[0])
  ROW []
  for x in range (len(a=[0])):
    row.append((A[i]+B[i])
    answer.append.row
               
print(answer)
