#Week 3
#Question 8
#Write a recursive function (pseudocode and code) that removes all vowels from a given
#string s. Input: "beautiful" Output: "btfl".

word = string("Enter Word")

def vowel_remove:

  if not word: #this code shows that there will be an empty string 
      return word

elif word[] in "aeiouAEIOU" # this line of code will show will display words if the first character of the word is a vowel
  Return remove.vowels () # this line of code will then skip the first letter moving onto the next letters and so on removing the vowel

print ("The vowels have been removed from the word")
print (vowel remove)
