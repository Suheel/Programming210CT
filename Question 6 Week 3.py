# Week 3
# Question 6
#Write the pseudocode and code for a function that reverses the words in a sentence. Input:
#"This is awesome" Output: "awesome is This". Give the Big O notation.

text= "This is awesome"
text = text.split ('  ') # this line of code splits the words of a sentence into seperate words
i = len
text = ''
while i > = 0
     text = words[] # this code will then print the sentence in reverse order
     i = 1
print (text)


# Pseudocode

#TEXT < -- INPUT TEXT
# WORDS < -- (TEXT) SPLIT
# INDEX = LENGTH
# TEXT < -- ()
# WHILE < -- INDEX > = 0
#PRINT TEXT
# THE BIG O NOTATION FOR THIS QUESTION IS 0.
